        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">I was inspired by Martin of the band Wintergatan (better known for their Marble Machine music video) 
            and his “Modulin”, a modular synthesizer set up with a ribbon controller which could be held and played something like a violin. 
            I used a combination of a soft linear potentiometer and a force-sensitive resistor stacked one on top of the other 
            to make a pressure-sensitive ribbon. 
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">
            I connected this, along with some other inputs, up to an Arduino and processed the data into MIDI note values, 
            pitch bend, and control change data. I wrote an algorithm to quantize the pitch inputs from the ribbon to either chromatic tones 
            or a specific scale, while still allowing bending notes and sliding from note to note either smoothly or with a portamento, 
            in a way reminiscent of the ROLI Seaboard controllers.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">
            I really do want to have another go at this one some day, take it on again with new eyes 
            and all the knowledge and experience I've gained since, 
            I think it has the potential to be a really fun musical instrument and a cool product.
